# Drop the leased test-database slots that belong to a superseded schema.
#
# `crates/storage-postgres/src/test_database.rs` names every slot
# `<base>_s<fingerprint>_slot<NN>`, where the fingerprint is eight hex
# characters of `sha256(migrations/00000000000000_initial/up.sql)`. This
# repository rewrites that migration in place, and Diesel only applies
# migrations it has not seen, so a slot created under an older revision would
# otherwise keep its old schema forever. Renaming the family fixes that; this
# script reclaims the families nothing will lease again.
#
# A database with an open connection cannot be dropped: PostgreSQL refuses,
# this reports it and moves on, so a concurrent run is never disturbed.
#
# Usage:
#   SOLAND_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:root@localhost/soland_dev \
#     scripts/drop-stale-test-databases.sh          # report only
#   ... scripts/drop-stale-test-databases.sh --drop # actually drop
