# ARC-0002 deletion gate (arkret 大架构重构计划 2026-07-10, W0).
#
# Legacy patterns slated for deletion must ratchet monotonically to zero:
#   - count above baseline  -> FAIL (new debt introduced)
#   - count below baseline  -> FAIL (progress! tighten the baseline below)
#   - zero-baseline pattern -> any occurrence fails outright
#
# When a migration wave lands, update the baseline in the BASELINES table
# to the new (lower) count in the same commit. The gate reaches its final
# form when every baseline is 0.
#
# Usage: scripts/deletion_gate.sh
