# Run the local test gate and leave machine-readable evidence behind.
#
# Three things this exists to fix, all of which have cost real debugging time:
#
#   * `--quiet` — the per-test log runs to thousands of lines. A terminal
#     scrollback that truncates it hides the failure summary, which is at the
#     end.
#   * bounded `--jobs` — at full parallelism a low-memory or Windows runner
#     fails to mmap an rlib (`os error 1455`, the pagefile is too small). That
#     surfaces as a *test* failure and sends people chasing a bug that is not
#     there. One job removes it; raise `SOLAND_GATE_JOBS` on a machine with
#     headroom.
#   * saved artifacts — the exit status and an extracted summary are written to
#     files, so the verdict never depends on what happened to still be on
#     screen. Read `$SOLAND_GATE_DIR/summary.txt`, not the terminal tail.
#
# Runs with `--no-fail-fast` so one early failure does not hide the rest.
# Exits with cargo's status.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gate.sh                                  # whole workspace
#   scripts/gate.sh -p soland --test extensions_smoke
#
# Every argument is forwarded to `cargo test`, so a narrow re-run keeps the same
# quiet output, the same bounded parallelism and the same artifacts.
