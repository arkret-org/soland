//! Durable SecurityRotation coordinator worker.
//!
//! `revoke`, `upload_new_material`, `switch_authoritative_pointer` and
//! `erase_old_material` are coordinator-owned steps (security-transactions.md
//! §1.1, §3): the Station advances them, never a client request. Every transition is a
//! registered storage unit, so a sweep that finds a transaction mid-way only
//! resumes it; the process holds no rotation state of its own.
