//! High-risk key-backup delete authority (`key-management.md` §7.8 / §7.8.1).
//!
//! # Why this is not "verify a proof"
//!
//! §7.8 judged the previous shape dead: a `DetachedJws` proof over a
//! locally-invented transcript, plus a `Development` branch whose "proof" was
//! an unauthenticated actor/backup string. Neither
//! carried server-issued freshness, so both were replayable for as long as the
//! envelope existed.
//!
//! The replacement is a three-step protocol, and the steps only work together:
//!
//! 1. the client asks for a challenge (`issue_key_backup_delete_challenge`). The server mints every
//!    freshness value — §7.8.1 forbids accepting a caller-minted nonce — and stores it durably,
//!    single-use, with a TTL of at most 300 s.
//! 2. the client signs the **canonical delete-intent transcript**, which embeds every field of that
//!    challenge verbatim. So a replay, an expired challenge, a different backup, a different
//!    audience or a different service fails at signature verification as well as at challenge
//!    lookup — two independent gates, not one.
//! 3. the server verifies one of the three closed authority branches and consumes the challenge in
//!    the same step as the delete.
//!
//! An ordinary current-device session proof is deliberately **not** a fourth
//! branch (§7.8): a caller holding only that is limited to envelopes that are
//! already expired and outside the active series.
