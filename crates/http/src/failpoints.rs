//! Development-only fault injection registry.
//!
//! Durable workflows (recovery, rotation, upload) need a way to prove they are
//! crash-consistent: an attempt that persists part of its work and then fails
//! MUST be resumable without corrupting the transaction. Reproducing that from
//! the outside is unreliable, so the server exposes a *typed* injection point.
//!
//! Rules this module exists to enforce:
//!
//! - The registry is only ever non-empty when `development_mode` is on. A release deployment parses
//!   no failpoints at all, so no business step can observe one.
//! - Failpoint names are a closed enum resolved once at startup. A typo in the environment is a
//!   startup error, not a silently inert failpoint.
//! - Business code consumes a [`ScopedFailpoint`] bound to one request attempt. It cannot read the
//!   environment, cannot re-arm itself, and cannot leak the configuration into a response.
//! - Diagnostics name the failpoint id only — never the request, the transaction body, or any key
//!   material.
