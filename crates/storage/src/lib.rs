//! Backend-neutral persistence records, ports, and adapter contracts.
//!
//! PostgreSQL is Soland's current durable production adapter, but it is not
//! part of this crate's public boundary. A future SQLite or other durable
//! adapter implements these same ports and contract suites without exposing
//! backend client, query, transaction, or row types to services and HTTP.
//! Backend-specific code belongs in an adapter crate such as
//! `soland-storage-postgres`.

// Crate-private imports shared by the explicitly imported storage modules.
