//! The Event digest preimage has one implementation, and it is in the SDK.
//!
//! `conformance/encoding.md` §6 excludes `proofs`, `unsigned`, `actor_kind` and
//! `event_id` from the digest preimage. Production ingest already goes through
//! it (`event_canonical_bytes` -> `Event::digest_payload`); the copy that
//! drifted was in this crate's own test helpers, where
//! `event_canonical_digest` kept `event_id` and `actor_kind` in the preimage and
//! stripped two slots that no longer exist on the envelope. Every digest it
//! produced was therefore one the server could never reach, which makes a
//! federation test assert against a value nothing computes.
//!
//! Removing `proofs` alone is deliberately not flagged: `EventBatchReceipt`,
//! `PrincipalLocator`, range-completeness attestations and DID documents all
//! legally strip their own `proofs` before signing, and none of them carries an
//! `event_id` or `actor_kind` to drop.
