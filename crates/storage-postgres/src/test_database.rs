//! Leased PostgreSQL databases for tests.
//!
//! Soland persists through one adapter. A test that needs storage leases a real
//! database instead of reaching for a second, in-memory implementation, so the
//! suite exercises exactly what production runs.
//!
//! A lease is exclusive for the life of its guard. The slot is claimed with a
//! session-level advisory lock held on a dedicated connection, so a crashed or
//! killed test releases it when its session ends, and every table that carries
//! rows is emptied before the leasing test observes the database. Slots are
//! reused, which makes a run cost one migration per slot instead of one per
//! test: creating a fresh database or schema measures at 1.4-1.9 s here, while
//! emptying the handful of tables a test dirtied measures at 9 ms to probe plus
//! a few milliseconds to delete.
//!
//! There is no in-memory fallback and no skip. Without a reachable database
//! [`TestDatabase::lease`] panics, which fails the test rather than emptying it.
//!
//! # Schema freshness
//!
//! Slot names carry [`schema_fingerprint`], eight hex characters of
//! `sha256(up.sql)`. This repository rewrites its single migration in place
//! (`AGENTS.md`: "需要修改数据库结构，直接修改现有 sql 文件"), and Diesel only
//! applies migrations it has not seen -- so a slot created under an older
//! revision keeps the schema it was born with while reporting the migration as
//! applied. Every "relation does not exist" run of this suite has been that,
//! never a regression.
//!
//! Editing the migration therefore renames the whole slot family and the next
//! run creates it fresh. Leaving it alone reuses the slots, which is what keeps
//! a run at one migration per slot instead of one per test. A timestamp suffix
//! would also be correct, but it would never reuse -- every run would pay the
//! full 1.4-1.9 s per slot and the server's database list would grow without
//! bound.
//!
//! `db.rs`'s `SCHEMA_CONTRACT_VERSION` fence does not cover this: it is a
//! hand-written constant that is also spelled in a `CHECK` constraint inside
//! `up.sql`, so it only moves when someone renames it -- which an in-place edit
//! never does. It still catches a database from before the migration squash;
//! the fingerprint is what catches an edit.
//!
//! Slots from a superseded fingerprint linger until dropped. Reclaim them with
//! `scripts/drop-stale-test-databases.sh`, which never touches a database that
//! has an open connection.
//!
//! # Runtime ownership
//!
//! The advisory lock lives in a PostgreSQL session, and that session dies with
//! the tokio runtime that drives its connection. Test runtimes are short-lived,
//! so the lock connection is established on a process-wide runtime owned by
//! this module instead. [`TestDatabase::lease_blocking`] drives the acquisition
//! on that runtime from a helper thread, which lets the fixture constructors
//! stay synchronous and infallible for their callers.
